A popular tradition at Carleton involves students competing to capture a bust of Schiller from one another. After a successful capture, Schiller’s guardians are expected to organize a surprise public display (often at concerts, athletic games, and other event), giving other students a chance to steal the bust. The beginning of the tradition is often dated to 1957, when Bruce Herrick ’58 “liberated” the original bust from the Scoville solarium. Since then, Schiller has been dangled from a helicopter over the Homecoming football game, was signed by President Clinton, and appeared on Comedy Central’s [i]Colbert Report[/i], among other things. The bust has been broken, repaired, and replaced many times.",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,https://archivedb.carleton.edu/files/20120524_1_Schiller,0
